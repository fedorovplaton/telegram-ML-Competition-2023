#! /usr/bin/gcl -f

; create a structure with named fields
;    here representing a fraction with two fields,
;    one for the numerator, one for the denominator
(defstruct Fraction num denom)

; this auto-creates the following:
;   (make-Fraction) which creates a fraction
;   (Fraction-p f)  which tests if f is a fraction
;   (Fraction-num f) which returns f's num field
;   (Fraction-denom f) which returns f's denom field
;   (copy-Fraction f) which creates a copy of f

; create a new fraction, store in x
(setf x (make-Fraction))
; set x to 3/4
(setf (Fraction-num x) 3)
(setf (Fraction-denom x) 4)
; create a new fraction, y, with value 5/6
(setf y (make-Fraction :num 5 :denom 6))
; print the fractions
(format t "x is ~A, y is ~A~%" x y)
