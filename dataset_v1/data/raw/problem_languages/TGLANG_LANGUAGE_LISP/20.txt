; unwind-protect allows the execution of a sequence of statements,
;    but executes all statements even if an earlier statement is
;    interrupted (unlike the behaviour of regular blocks)
; e.g.
;    (unwind-protect
;       (stmt1)
;       (stmt2)
;       (stmt3))
;
; this is typically used when there is some form of clean-up
;    action we want to perform even if something else in
;    the loop fails (e.g. closing files, pipes, etc)
